# Order Optimization System for Paper Cutting

This project is an order optimization system for paper cutting, for a manufacturing or distribution company.

## Key Features

### 1. Order Data Processing
- Processes order data from CSV files

### 2. Automatic Roll Size Calculation
- Calculates roll sizes automatically based on order widths

### 3. Genetic Algorithm (GA) Optimization
- Utilizes genetic algorithms for order optimization

### 4. Linear Programming (LP) Optimization
- Potential for implementing linear programming optimization techniques

## Technical Stack

- **Data Processing**: Python (pandas)
- **Optimization Algorithms**: 
  - Genetic Algorithms (pygad)
  - Linear Programming (potential implementation)
- **Web Interface**: Django (for future development)
